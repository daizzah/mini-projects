# Math Buddy 📐

**Math Buddy** is a lightweight Python app built with Tkinter to help students practice Algebra, Trigonometry, and Geometry problems.

Originally created for my sister, who wanted a simple tool for her and her classmates to study math more interactively, Math Buddy works like digital flashcards — instantly generating and solving practice problems in a clean, focused interface.

## Features

- Instant question generation and auto-solving
- Categorized interface by math type (Algebra, Trig, Geometry)
- Minimalist UI designed for fast practice and concept reinforcement

🔧 Built for desktop use with Python and Tkinter.
